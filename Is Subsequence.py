'''
Given two strings s and t, check if s is a subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

# Two Pointers

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

        while p_left < LEFT_BOUND and p_right < RIGHT_BOUND:
            # move both pointers or just the right pointer
            if s[p_left] == t[p_right]:
                p_left += 1
            p_right += 1

        return p_left == LEFT_BOUND
